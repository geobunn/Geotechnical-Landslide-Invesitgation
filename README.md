# Geotechnical-Landslide-Invesitgation
## Overview

This web map provides a brief history of the Hooskanaden Landslide, one of Oregon's most damaging landslides.

**You can view the map [here](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~bunnmi/)!**

## Project Components

### Setup
The first three scenes of this storymap describe the setup, or background, of the story of Hooskanaden. The first scene describes why landslides occur in Oregon, the second scene provides information specifically about the Hooskanaden landslide, and the third scene describes the landslide monitoring that has been performed in an attempt to measure the slide's movements.

### Confrontation
The confrontation part of Hooskanaden's story was when the landslide moved significantly in February of 2019. The landslide event was the largest to occur in Oregon for more than a decade, and had a significant impact on the nearby communities that rely on the highway destroyed by the slide.

### Resolution
The story of Hooskanaden has not yet been fully resolved, and construction crews are working hard to repair the highway. Eventually the highway will be operational, and eventually the slide will move again. The last scene of the storymap will show a video of repairs being made. This scene is intended to give the viewer a sense that the landslide will never be stopped completely.
